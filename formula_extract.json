(Work vs. Speed):** Benchmarks measure **Speed** (Clock Frequency), which scales power quadratically ($P \\propto V^2 \\times f$). High benchmark scores often mean high power drain, not efficiency. AES measures **Work-per-Clock** (IPC), which scales performance linearly without the voltage penalty. The architectural baseline quality of the cores across generations scales approximately linearly in its ability to offer proportionately better work-per-watt efficiency at baseline loads.\n        > 2. **Why No Frequency Adjustment? (The \"Efficiency Core\" Reality):** While peak clock frequency dramatically increases maximum power draw (which hurts performance/watt at peak load), battery endurance tests primarily simulate mixed-use, video playback, and standby scenarios. In these scenarios, the CPU spends the vast majority of its time in deep sleep or running at low-power clock domains. Battery life is dominated by the efficiency cores (e.g., Cortex-A520/A55) that handle 80% of daily background tasks. Therefore, the *intrinsic architectural efficiency* (IPC) of the cluster matters far more for predicting whole-day endurance than the chip's theoretical maximum speed limit. AES is the *only* metric that accounts for the generational quality of the efficiency cores, accurately predicting the device's idle/low-load power profile. Peak power penalties are handled naturally during active high-load benchmarking (Method A) or indirectly through thermal bleeding, not at the baseline calculation step.\n"
