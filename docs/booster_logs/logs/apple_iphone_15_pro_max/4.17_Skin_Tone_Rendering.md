# Verification Log: Section 11.3 Update

**Target Subsection:** 4.17 Semantic / Scene AI Processing  
**Source:** [iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Test](https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-camera-test/)
**Verification Iterations:** 2

## 1. Rule 11.A: Core Principles
- [x] **Unaccounted Feature Requirement:** The quality of the "Smart HDR" algorithm is NOT scored in Section 4.17, which is a binary checklist for the presence of semantic segmentation features.
- [x] **Real-World Test Exclusion:** Section 4.17 is a feature presence tier (0/6/10), not a real-world benchmark performance score like 3.1 or 5.1.
- [x] **No Overlap:** This focused improvement on skin tone rendering does not overlap with general Color Gamut (Section 2.4, which measures range not accuracy) or Texture (Section 4.16).
- [x] **Complete Assessment:** The booster is strictly specific to the skin tone rendering quality gap and does not double-count general camera scores.

## 2. Rule 11.B: Justification Logic
- [x] **Source Link:** https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-camera-test/ (Active and Valid)
- [x] **Impacted Subsection:** 4.17 (Correctly targets the AI processing section)
- [x] **Booster:** 1.05 (Review indicates "improved" and "natural" results, justifying a 5% boost)
- [x] **Justification Chain:**
    - **Cause (Unaccounted Feature):** "The smart HDR feature helped produce very natural and pleasant colors, even in very challenging light conditions."
    - **Gap (Unaccounted Reason):** Section 4.17 scores the binary presence of semantic segmentation. It does not measure the *quality* of the tuning or the specific effectiveness of Smart HDR in delivering accurate skin tones.
    - **Effect (Observed Justification):** "Skin tones were improved compared to the already very good Apple iPhone 14 Pro, across all skin tone types."
- [x] **Extract Requirement:** Both extracts are exact verbatim copies from the "Color" section of the DXOMARK review.
- [x] **Technical Causality:** The "Smart HDR" algorithm (Cause) is explicitly credited in the review for producing the "natural... colors" and "improved" skin tones (Effect).

## 3. Rule 11.C: Evidence Requirements
- [x] **Proof & Precision:** Extracts cite specific improvements ("natural", "pleasant", "improved") and specific scopes ("even in very challenging light conditions", "across all skin tone types").
- [x] **Source Verification:** DXOMARK is the primary reputable source for this domain.
- [x] **Specificity:** The justification is highly specific to skin tone rendering and the Smart HDR feature.
- [x] **Decomposition:** This booster is decomposed to focus only on the Color/Skin Tone aspect, separate from Texture or Zoom.

## 4. Rule 11.D: Conclusion
- [x] **Verification Status:** **PASS**
- [x] **Action:** Commit
